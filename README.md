# Youtube-8M Video-Level Features Analysis
In this project, we will apply various big data analytics techniques and algorithms in order to study the YouTube-8M dataset which contains machine generated labels, RGB features and audio features
for each videos on YouTube platform. We will find out the dominant video categories, frequent itemsets of video categories and group videos into clusters using available features.

## Task
1. Dominant categories on YouTube
2. K-th Frequent Itemsets of video categories
3. Group videos into clusters according to RGB features and audio features

## Approach
1. Count video categories under MapReduce framework using key = category id
2. Implement Apriori algorithm under MapReduce framework
3. Implement K-Means algorithm
